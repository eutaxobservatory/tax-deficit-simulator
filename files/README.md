# Resources

This folder gathers useful documents that explain our estimation methodology and describe the main results.

## Publications

The `publications` sub-folder provides our successive publications based on the simulation of Pillar Two revenue effects:

- `Baraké et al. (2021a) - EUTAX Report 1.pdf` corresponds to the EU Tax Observatory's first report of June 2021;

## Methodological notes

The `methodology` sub-folder contains technical notes that complements the publications listed above:

- `Baraké et al. (2022) - Intertax - Online Appendix.pdf` accompanies the *Intertax* article. With the paper itself, it constitutes the most exhaustive methodological reference for our computations up to 2022 included (see the [v1.0](https://github.com/eutaxobservatory/tax-deficit-simulator/tree/v1.0) release);
- `Data and code update (2023) - Methodological note.pdf` delineates the methodological, data and code updates introduced in 2023. Note that this document focuses on the *updates* with respect to previous computations: for most of the data cleaning arbitrages, computations, etc. that have remained unchanged, we explicitly refer to previous documents or simply skip them.
